        "abstract": "HLA-A*1101 is one of the most common human class I alleles worldwide. An increased frequency of HLA-A*1101 has been observed in cohorts of female sex workers from Northern Thailand who are highly exposed to HIV-1 and yet have remained persistently seronegative. In view of this apparent association of HLA-A*1101 with resistance to acquisition of HIV-1 infection, and given the importance of eliciting strong CTL responses to control and eliminate HIV-1, we have determined the crystal structure of HLA-A*1101 complexed with two immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitopes: the nonamer reverse transcriptase(313-321) (AIFQSSMTK) and decamer Nef(73-82) (QVPLRPMTYK) peptides. The structures confirm the presence of primary anchor residues P2-Ile/-Val and P9-/P10-Lys, and also clearly reveal the presence of secondary anchor residues P6-Ser for reverse transcriptase and P7-Met for Nef. The overall backbone conformation of both peptides is defined as two bulges that are separated by a more buried middle residue. In this study, we discuss how this topology may offer functional advantages in the selection and presentation of HIV-1 CTL epitopes by HLA-A*1101. Overall, this structural analysis permits a more accurate definition of the peptide-binding motif of HLA-A*1101, the characterization of its antigenic surface, and the correlation of molecular determinants with resistance to HIV-1 infection. These studies are relevant for the rational design of HLA-A*1101-restricted CTL epitopes with improved binding and immunological properties for the development of HIV-1 vaccines.",
