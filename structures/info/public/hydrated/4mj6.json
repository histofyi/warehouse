        "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>\u2003The emergence of infections by the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has posed a threat to human health. Cross-immunity between A(H7N9) and other heterosubtypic influenza viruses affected by antigenicity-dependent substitutions needs to be investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>\u2003We investigated the cellular and humoral immune responses against A(H7N9) and 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), by serological and T-cell-specific assays, in a healthy population. The molecular bases of the cellular and humoral antigenic variability of A(H7N9) were illuminated by structural determination.<h4>Results</h4>\u2003We not only found that antibodies against A(H7N9) were lacking in the studied population, but also revealed that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that cross-reacted with A(H7N9) were at significantly lower levels than those against the A(H1N1)pdm09 peptides with substitutions. Moreover, individual peptides for A(H7N9) with low cross-reactivity were identified. Structural determination indicated that substitutions within these peptides influence the antigenic variability of A(H7N9) through both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding and T-cell receptor docking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>\u2003The impact of antigenicity-dependent substitutions on cross-reactivity of T-cell immunity against the novel influenza virus A(H7N9) in the healthy population benefits the understanding of immune evasion of influenza viruses and provides a useful reference for universal vaccine development.",
