    "abstract": "Transformation acoustics, as an unconventional theory, provides a powerful tool to design various kinds of acoustic devices with excellent functionalities. However, the required ideal parameters, which are prescribed by the method, are both complex and hard to implement-even using acoustic metamaterials. Furthermore, simplified parameter materials are generally favored in transformation-acoustic design due to its easier realization with artificial structures. In this letter, we propose a coordinate transformation methodology for achieving simplified parameters by tuning the impedance distribution in the geometric limit, where the transformation media parameters can be derived by setting tunable impedance functions in the original space and a combination of suitable linear or nonlinear coordinate transformation. Based on this approach, both two-dimensional acoustic cloak and concentrators are designed with different sets of simplified parameters. Numerical simulations indicate good performance of these devices with minimized scattering at higher frequencies. The proposed method provides more opportunities to realize the designed acoustic devices experimentally, and can also be used for other transformation-acoustic designs including 3D cases.",
