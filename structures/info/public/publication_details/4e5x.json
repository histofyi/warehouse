    "abstract": "E3-19K binds to and retains MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, suppressing anti-adenovirus activities of T cells. We determined the structure of the adenovirus serotype 2 (Ad2, species C) E3-19K-HLA-A2 complex to 1.95-\u00c5 resolution. Ad2 E3-19K binds to the N terminus of the HLA-A2 groove, contacting the \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 domains and \u03b2(2)m. Ad2 E3-19K has a unique structure comprising a large N-terminal domain, formed by two partially overlapping \u03b2-sheets arranged in a V shape, and a C-terminal \u03b1-helix and tail. The structure reveals determinants in E3-19K and HLA-A2 that are important for complex formation; conservation of some of these determinants in E3-19K proteins of different species and MHC I molecules of different loci suggests a universal binding mode for all E3-19K proteins. Our structure is important for understanding the immunomodulatory function of E3-19K.",
