    "abstract": "The nature of the antigens recognized by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and their potential recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-like molecules has remained unclear. Members of the CD1 family of lipid-presenting molecules are suggested ligands for V\u03b41 TCR-expressing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, the major \u03b3\u03b4 lymphocyte population in epithelial tissues. We crystallized a V\u03b41 TCR in complex with CD1d and the self-lipid sulfatide, revealing the unusual recognition of CD1d by germline V\u03b41 residues spanning all complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, as well as sulfatide recognition separately encoded by nongermline CDR3\u03b4 residues. Binding and functional analysis showed that CD1d presenting self-lipids, including sulfatide, was widely recognized by gut V\u03b41+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. These findings provide structural demonstration of MHC-like recognition of a self-lipid by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and reveal the prevalence of lipid recognition by innate-like T cell populations.",
