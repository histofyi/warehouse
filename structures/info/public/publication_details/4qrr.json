    "abstract": "\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are disparate T cell lineages that can respond to distinct antigens (Ags) via the use of the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell Ag receptors (TCRs), respectively. Here we characterize a population of human T cells, which we term \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2 T cells, expressing TCRs comprised of a TCR-\u03b4 variable gene (V\u03b41) fused to joining \u03b1 and constant \u03b1 domains, paired with an array of TCR-\u03b2 chains. We demonstrate that these cells, which represent \u223c50% of all V\u03b41(+) human T cells, can recognize peptide- and lipid-based Ags presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and CD1d, respectively. Similar to type I natural killer T (NKT) cells, CD1d-lipid Ag-reactive \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2 T cells recognized \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer); however, their fine specificity for other lipid Ags presented by CD1d, such as \u03b1-glucosylceramide, was distinct from type I NKT cells. Thus, \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCRs contribute new patterns of Ag specificity to the human immune system. Furthermore, we provide the molecular bases of how \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCRs bind to their targets, with the V\u03b41-encoded region providing a major contribution to \u03b4/\u03b1\u03b2TCR binding. Our findings highlight how components from \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4TCR gene loci can recombine to confer Ag specificity, thus expanding our understanding of T cell biology and TCR diversity.",
