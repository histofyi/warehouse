    "abstract": "Unlike conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells typically recognize nonpeptide ligands independently of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. Accordingly, the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell receptor (TCR) can potentially recognize a wide array of ligands; however, few ligands have been described to date. While there is a growing appreciation of the molecular bases underpinning variable (V)\u03b41<sup>+</sup> and V\u03b42<sup>+</sup> \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-mediated ligand recognition, the mode of V\u03b43<sup>+</sup> TCR ligand engagement is unknown. MHC class I-related protein, MR1, presents vitamin B metabolites to \u03b1\u03b2 T cells known as mucosal-associated invariant T cells, diverse MR1-restricted T cells, and a subset of human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Here, we identify V\u03b41/2<sup>-</sup> \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the blood and duodenal biopsy specimens of children that showed metabolite-independent binding of MR1 tetramers. Characterization of one V\u03b43V\u03b38 TCR clone showed MR1 reactivity was independent of the presented antigen. Determination of two V\u03b43V\u03b38 TCR-MR1-antigen complex structures revealed a recognition mechanism by the V\u03b43 TCR chain that mediated specific contacts to the side of the MR1 antigen-binding groove, representing a previously uncharacterized MR1 docking topology. The binding of the V\u03b43<sup>+</sup> TCR to MR1 did not involve contacts with the presented antigen, providing a basis for understanding its inherent MR1 autoreactivity. We provide molecular insight into antigen-independent recognition of MR1 by a V\u03b43<sup>+</sup> \u03b3\u03b4 TCR that strengthens an emerging paradigm of antibody-like ligand engagement by \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs.",
