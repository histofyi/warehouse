    "abstract": "Micropolymorphisms within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules can change the architecture of the peptide-binding cleft, leading to differences in peptide presentation and T cell recognition. The impact of such HLA variation on natural killer (NK) cell recognition remains unclear. Given the differential association of HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*57:03 with the control of HIV, recognition of these HLA-B57 allomorphs by the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL1 was compared. Despite differing by only two polymorphic residues, both buried within the peptide-binding cleft, HLA-B*57:01 more potently inhibited NK cell activation. Direct-binding studies showed KIR3DL1 to preferentially recognize HLA-B*57:01, particularly when presenting peptides with positively charged position (P)\u03a9-2 residues. In HLA-B*57:01, charged P\u03a9-2 residues were oriented toward the peptide-binding cleft and away from KIR3DL1. In HLA-B*57:03, the charged P\u03a9-2 residues protruded out from the cleft and directly impacted KIR3DL1 engagement. Accordingly, KIR3DL1 recognition of HLA class I ligands is modulated by both the peptide sequence and conformation, as determined by the HLA polymorphic framework, providing a rationale for understanding differences in clinical associations.",
