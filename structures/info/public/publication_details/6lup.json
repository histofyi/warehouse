    "abstract": "Cartilaginous fish are the most primitive extant species with MHC molecules. Using the nurse shark, the current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to present a peptide-loaded MHC class I (pMHC-I) structure for this class of animals. The overall structure was found to be similar between cartilaginous fish and bony animals, showing remarkable conservation of interactions between the three pMHC-I components H chain, \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m), and peptide ligand. In most previous studies, relatively little attention was given to the details of binding between the H chain and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m, and our study provides important new insights. A pronounced conserved feature involves the insertion of a large \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m F56+W60 hydrophobic knob into a pleat of the \u03b2-sheet floor of the H chain \u03b11\u03b12 domain, with the knob being surrounded by conserved residues. Another conserved feature is a hydrogen bond between \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m Y10 and a proline in the \u03b13 domain of the H chain. By alanine substitution analysis, we found that the conserved \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m residues Y10, D53, F56, and W60-each binding the H chain-are required for stable pMHC-I complex formation. For the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m residues Y10 and F56, such observations have not been reported before. The combined data indicate that for stable pMHC-I complex formation \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m should not only bind the \u03b11\u03b12 domain but also the \u03b13 domain. Knowing the conserved structural features of pMHC-I should be helpful for future elucidations of the mechanisms of pMHC-I complex formation and peptide editing.",
