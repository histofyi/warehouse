    "abstract": "The human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clone 6C5 has previously been shown to recognize the <i>tert</i>-butyl-modified Bax<sub>161-170</sub> peptide LLSY(3-<i>t</i>Bu)FGTPT presented by HLA-A*02:01. This nonnatural epitope was likely created as a by-product of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl protecting group peptide synthesis and bound poorly to HLA-A*02:01. In this study, we used a systematic approach to identify and characterize natural ligands for the 6C5 TCR. Functional analyses revealed that 6C5 T cells only recognized the LLSYFGTPT peptide when <i>t</i>Bu was added to the tyrosine residue and did not recognize the LLSYFGTPT peptide modified with larger (di-<i>t</i>Bu) or smaller chemical groups (Me). Combinatorial peptide library screening further showed that 6C5 T cells recognized a series of self-derived peptides with dissimilar amino acid sequences to LLSY(3-<i>t</i>Bu)FGTPT. Structural studies of LLSY(3-<i>t</i>Bu)FGTPT and two other activating nonamers (IIGWMWIPV and LLGWVFAQV) in complex with HLA-A*02:01 demonstrated similar overall peptide conformations and highlighted the importance of the position (P) 4 residue for T cell recognition, particularly the capacity of the bulky amino acid tryptophan to substitute for the <i>t</i>Bu-modified tyrosine residue in conjunction with other changes at P5 and P6. Collectively, these results indicated that chemical modifications directly altered the immunogenicity of a synthetic peptide via molecular mimicry, leading to the inadvertent activation of a T cell clone with unexpected and potentially autoreactive specificities.",
