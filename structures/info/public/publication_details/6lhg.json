    "abstract": "The CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer is crucial to both thymic T cell selection and the antigen recognition of cytotoxic T cells. The CD8-pMHC-I interaction can enhance CTL immunity <i>via</i> stabilizing the TCR-pMHC-I interaction and optimizing the cross-reactivity and Ag sensitivity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at various stages of development. To date, only human and mouse CD8-pMHC-I complexes have been determined. Here, we resolved the pBF2*1501 complex and the cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*1501 and cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*0401 complexes in nonmammals for the first time. Remarkably, cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*1501 and the cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*0401 complex both exhibited two binding modes, including an \"antibody-like\" mode similar to that of the known mammal CD8/pMHC-I complexes and a \"face-to-face\" mode that has been observed only in chickens to date. Compared to the \"antibody-like\" mode, the \"face-to-face\" binding mode changes the binding orientation of the cCD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer to pMHC-I, which might facilitate abundant \u03b3\u03b4T cells to bind diverse peptides presented by limited BF2 alleles in chicken. Moreover, the forces involving in the interaction of cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*1501 and the cCD8\u03b1\u03b1/pBF2*0401 are different in this two binding model, which might change the strength of the CD8-pMHC-I interaction, amplifying T cell cross-reactivity in chickens. The coreceptor CD8\u03b1\u03b1 of TCR has evolved two peptide-MHC-I binding patterns in chickens, which might enhance the T cell response to major or emerging pathogens, including chicken-derived pathogens that are relevant to human health, such as high-pathogenicity influenza viruses.",
