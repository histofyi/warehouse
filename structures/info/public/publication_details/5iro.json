    "abstract": "Adenoviruses (Ads) subvert MHC class I Ag presentation and impair host anti-Ad cellular activities. Specifically, the Ad-encoded E3-19K immunomodulatory protein targets MHC class I molecules for retention within the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. We report the x-ray crystal structure of the Ad type 4 (Ad4) E3-19K of species E bound to HLA-A2 at 2.64-\u00c5 resolution. Structural analysis shows that Ad4 E3-19K adopts a tertiary fold that is shared only with Ad2 E3-19K of species C. A comparative analysis of the Ad4 E3-19K/HLA-A2 structure with our x-ray structure of Ad2 E3-19K/HLA-A2 identifies species-specific features in HLA-A2 recognition. Our analysis also reveals common binding characteristics that explain the promiscuous, and yet high-affinity, association of E3-19K proteins with HLA-A and HLA-B molecules. We also provide structural insights into why E3-19K proteins do not associate with HLA-C molecules. Overall, our study provides new information about how E3-19K proteins selectively engage with MHC class I to abrogate Ag presentation and counteract activation of CD8(+) T cells. The significance of MHC class I Ag presentation for controlling viral infections, as well as the threats of viral infections in immunocompromised patients, underline our efforts to characterize viral immunoevasins, such as E3-19K.",
