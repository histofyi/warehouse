    "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Similar to antibody detection, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T-cell response evaluation is also pivotal among the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents and the vaccinated populations. Nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the main structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and can trigger T-cell responses in humans.<h4>Methods</h4>An overlapping peptide pool covering the full length of the N protein was designed, peptides with positive T-cell activating potency in COVID-19 convalescents were screened, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes were further identified. The epitope was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents based in intracellular cytokine staining and tetramer staining in flow cytometry.<h4>Results</h4>A human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A)*1101-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope, which could stimulate the production of IFN-\u03b3 via peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the convalescents was defined, and the tetramer generated with this epitope could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the PBMCs of the convalescents. The structural investigation eliminated that the epitope was a typical HLA-A*1101-restricted T-cell epitope which was conserved among all the sarbecoviruses.<h4>Discussion</h4>The newly identified SARS-CoV-2-derived T-cell epitope was helpful to detect the cellular immunity against different sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This study provided an evaluation method and also a peptide candidate for the research and development of T-cell based vaccine for the virus.",
