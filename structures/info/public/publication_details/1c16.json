    "abstract": "Murine T10 and T22 are highly related nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib proteins that bind to certain gammadelta T cell receptors (TCRs) in the absence of other components. The crystal structure of T22b at 3.1 angstroms reveals similarities to MHC class I molecules, but one side of the normal peptide-binding groove is severely truncated, which allows direct access to the beta-sheet floor. Potential gammadelta TCR-binding sites can be inferred from functional mapping of T10 and T22 point mutants and allelic variants. Thus, T22 represents an unusual variant of the MHC-like fold and indicates that gammadelta and alphabeta TCRs interact differently with their respective MHC ligands.",
