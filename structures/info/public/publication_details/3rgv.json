    "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) and MHCII proteins differ in structure and sequence. To understand how T\u00a0cell receptors (TCRs) can use the same set of variable regions to bind both proteins, we have presented a comparison of a single TCR bound to both MHCI and MHCII ligands. The TCR adopts similar orientations on both ligands with TCR amino acids thought to be evolutionarily conserved for MHC interaction occupying similar positions on the MHCI and MHCII helices. However, the TCR antigen-binding loops use different conformations when interacting with each ligand. Most importantly, we observed alternate TCR core conformations. When bound to MHCI, but not MHCII, V\u03b1 disengages from the J\u03b1 \u03b2 strand, switching V\u03b1's position relative to V\u03b2. In several other structures, either V\u03b1 or V\u03b2 undergoes this same modification. Thus, both TCR V-domains can switch among alternate conformations, perhaps extending their ability to react with different MHC-peptide ligands.",
