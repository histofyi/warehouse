    "abstract": "Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) rapidly produce effector cytokines. In this study, we report the first crystal structures of the iNKT cell T cell receptor (TCR) bound to two natural, microbial glycolipids presented by CD1d. Binding of the TCR induced CDR3-\u03b1-dependent structural changes in the F' roof of CD1d; these changes resemble those occurring in the absence of TCR engagement when the highly potent synthetic antigen \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer) binds CD1d. Furthermore, in the Borrelia burgdorferi \u03b1-galactosyl diacylglycerol-CD1d complex, TCR binding caused a marked repositioning of the galactose sugar into an orientation that closely resembles \u03b1-GalCer. The TCR-dependent reorientation of the sugar, together with the induced CD1d fit, may explain the weaker potency of the microbial antigens compared with \u03b1-GalCer. We propose that the TCR of iNKT cells binds with a conserved footprint onto CD1d, regardless of the bound glycolipid antigen, and that for microbial antigens this unique binding mode requires TCR-initiated conformational changes.",
