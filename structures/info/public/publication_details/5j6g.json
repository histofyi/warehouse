    "abstract": "Murine natural killer (NK) cells are regulated by the interaction of Ly49 receptors with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC-I). Although the ligands for inhibitory Ly49 were considered to be restricted to classical MHC (MHC-Ia), we have shown that the non-classical MHC molecule (MHC-Ib) H2-M3 was a ligand for the inhibitory Ly49A. Here we establish that another MHC-Ib, H2-Q10, is a bona fide ligand for the inhibitory Ly49C receptor. H2-Q10 bound to Ly49C with a marginally lower affinity (\u223c5 \u03bcm) than that observed between Ly49C and MHC-Ia (H-2K(b)/H-2D(d), both \u223c1 \u03bcm), and this recognition could be prevented by cis interactions with H-2K in situ To understand the molecular details underpinning Ly49\u00b7MHC-Ib recognition, we determined the crystal structures of H2-Q10 and Ly49C bound H2-Q10. Unliganded H2-Q10 adopted a classical MHC-I fold and possessed a peptide-binding groove that exhibited features similar to those found in MHC-Ia, explaining the diverse peptide binding repertoire of H2-Q10. Ly49C bound to H2-Q10 underneath the peptide binding platform to a region that encompassed residues from the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 domains, as well as the associated \u03b22-microglobulin subunit. This docking mode was conserved with that previously observed for Ly49C\u00b7H-2K(b) Indeed, structure-guided mutation of Ly49C indicated that Ly49C\u00b7H2-Q10 and Ly49C\u00b7H-2K(b) possess similar energetic footprints focused around residues located within the Ly49C \u03b24-stand and L5 loop, which contact the underside of the peptide-binding platform floor. Our data provide a structural basis for Ly49\u00b7MHC-Ib recognition and demonstrate that MHC-Ib represent an extended family of ligands for Ly49 molecules.",
