    "abstract": "EBV is one of the most common viruses found in humans and is prototypic of a persistent viral infection characterized by periods of latency. Across many HLA class I molecules, the latent-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is focused on epitopes derived from the EBNA-3 protein family. In the case of HLA-B*07:02 restriction, a highly frequent class I allele, the T cell response is dominated by an epitope spanning residues 379-387 of EBNA-3 (RPPIFIRRL [EBV<sub>RPP</sub>]). However, little is known about either the TCR repertoire specific for this epitope or the molecular basis for this observed immunodominance. The EBV<sub>RPP</sub> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response was common among both EBV-seropositive HLA-B*07:02<sup>+</sup> healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Similar TCRs were identified in EBV<sub>RPP</sub>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoires across multiple HLA-B7<sup>+</sup> individuals, indicating a shared Ag-driven bias in TCR usage. In particular, TRBV4-1 and TRAV38 usage was observed in five out of six individuals studied. In this study, we report the crystal structure of a TRBV4-1<sup>+</sup> TCR-HLA-B*07:02/EBV<sub>RPP</sub> complex, which provides a molecular basis for the observed TRBV4-1 bias. These findings enhance our understanding of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response toward a common EBV determinant in HLA-B*07:02<sup>+</sup> individuals.",
