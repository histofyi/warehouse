    "abstract": "\u03b1\u03b2-TCRs expressed at the CD8(+) T-cell surface interact with short peptide fragments (p) bound to MHC class I molecules (pMHCI). The TCR/pMHCI interaction is pivotal in all aspects of CD8(+) T-cell immunity. However, the rules that govern the outcome of TCR/pMHCI engagement are not entirely understood, and this is a major barrier to understanding the requirements for both effective immunity and vaccination. In the present study, we discovered an unexpected feature of the TCR/pMHCI interaction by showing that any given TCR exhibits an explicit preference for a single MHCI-peptide length. Agonists of nonpreferred length were extremely rare, suboptimal, and often entirely distinct in sequence. Structural analysis indicated that alterations in peptide length have a major impact on antigenic complexity, to which individual TCRs are unable to adapt. This novel finding demonstrates that the outcome of TCR/pMHCI engagement is determined by peptide length in addition to the sequence identity of the MHCI-bound peptide. Accordingly, the effective recognition of pMHCI Ag, which is a prerequisite for successful CD8(+) T-cell immunity and protective vaccination, can only be achieved by length-matched Ag-specific CD8(+) T-cell clonotypes.",
