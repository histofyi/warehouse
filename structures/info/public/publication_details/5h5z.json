    "abstract": "Contemporary antigen presentation knowledge is based on the existence of a single \u03b22m locus, and a classical MHC class I forms a complex with a peptide (i.e., pMHC-I) to trigger CTL immunity. However, two \u03b22m loci have been found in diploid bony fish; the function of the two \u03b22m molecules is unclear. Here, we determined the variant peptide profiles originating from different products of the \u03b22m loci binding to the same MHC-I molecule and further solved the crystal structures of the two pMHC-I molecules (i.e., pCtid-UAA-\u03b22m-2 and pCtid-UAA-\u03b22m-1-II). Of note, in pCtid-UAA-\u03b22m-2, a unique hydrogen bond network formed in the bottom of the peptide-binding groove (PBG) led to \u03b12-helix drift, ultimately leading to structural changes in the PBG. The mechanism of the change in peptide presentation profiles by \u03b22m molecules is illustrated. The results are also of great significance for antivirus and antitumor functions in cold-blooded vertebrates and even humans.",
