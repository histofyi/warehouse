    "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) engagement of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is essential to adaptive immunity, but it is unknown whether TCR signaling responses are influenced by the binding topology of the TCR-peptide-MHC complex. We developed yeast-displayed pMHC libraries that enabled us to identify new peptide sequences reactive with a single TCR. Structural analysis showed that four peptides bound to the TCR with distinct 3D and 2D affinities using entirely different binding chemistries. Three of the peptides that shared a common docking mode, where key TCR-MHC germline interactions are preserved, induced TCR signaling. The fourth peptide failed to induce signaling and was recognized in a substantially different TCR-MHC binding mode that apparently exceeded geometric tolerances compatible with signaling. We suggest that the stereotypical TCR-MHC docking paradigm evolved from productive signaling geometries and that TCR signaling can be modulated by peptides that are recognized in alternative TCR-pMHC binding orientations.",
