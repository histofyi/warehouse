    "abstract": "Lethal infections by strains of the highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 pose serious threats to both the poultry industry and public health worldwide. A lack of confirmed HPAIV epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has hindered the utilization of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated immunity and has precluded the development of effectively diversified epitope-based vaccination approaches. In particular, an HPAIV H5N1 CTL-recognized epitope based on the peptide MHC-I-\u03b22m (pMHC-I) complex has not yet been designed. Here, screening a collection of selected peptides of several HPAIV strains against a specific pathogen-free pMHC-I (pBF2*1501), we identified a highly-conserved HPAIV H5N1 CTL epitope, named HPAIV-PA<sub>123-130</sub> We determined the structure of the BF2*1501-PA<sub>123-130</sub> complex at 2.1 \u00c5 resolution to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of a preferential presentation of the highly-conserved PA<sub>123-130</sub> epitope in the chicken B15 lineage. Conformational characteristics of the PA<sub>123-130</sub> epitope with a protruding Tyr-7 residue indicated that this epitope has great potential to be recognized by specific TCRs. Moreover, significantly increased numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the HPAIV-PA<sub>123-130</sub> epitope in peptide-immunized chickens indicated that a repertoire of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can specifically respond to this epitope. We anticipate that the identification and structural characterization of the PA<sub>123-130</sub> epitope reported here could enable further studies of CTL immunity against HPAIV H5N1. Such studies may aid in the development of vaccine development strategies using well-conserved internal viral antigens in chickens.",
