    "abstract": "CD8+ T\u00a0cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity; however, understanding T\u00a0cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T\u00a0cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T\u00a0cells. Therefore, we have characterized eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A<sup>\u2217</sup>02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A<sup>\u2217</sup>02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T\u00a0cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T\u00a0cell response toward these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A<sup>\u2217</sup>02:01.",
