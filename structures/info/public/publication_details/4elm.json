    "abstract": "Selective metal coordination is central to the functions of metalloproteins:<sup>1,2</sup> each metalloprotein must pair with its cognate metallocofactor to fulfil its biological role<sup>3</sup>. However, achieving metal selectivity solely through a three-dimensional protein structure is a great challenge, because there is a limited set of metal-coordinating amino acid functionalities and proteins are inherently flexible, which impedes steric selection of metals<sup>3,4</sup>. Metal-binding affinities of natural proteins are primarily dictated by the electronic properties of metal ions and follow the Irving-Williams series<sup>5</sup> (Mn<sup>2+</sup>\u2009<\u2009Fe<sup>2+</sup>\u2009<\u2009Co<sup>2+</sup>\u2009<\u2009Ni<sup>2+</sup>\u2009<\u2009Cu<sup>2+</sup>\u2009>\u2009Zn<sup>2+</sup>) with few exceptions<sup>6,7</sup>. Accordingly, metalloproteins overwhelmingly bind Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> in isolation, regardless of the nature of their active sites and their cognate metal ions<sup>1,3,8</sup>. This led organisms to evolve complex homeostatic machinery and non-equilibrium strategies to achieve correct metal speciation<sup>1,3,8-10</sup>. Here we report an artificial dimeric protein, (AB)<sub>2</sub>, that thermodynamically overcomes the Irving-Williams restrictions in vitro and in cells, favouring the binding of lower-Irving-Williams transition metals over Cu<sup>2+</sup>, the most dominant ion in the Irving-Williams series. Counter to the convention in molecular design of achieving specificity through structural preorganization, (AB)<sub>2</sub> was deliberately designed to be flexible. This flexibility enabled (AB)<sub>2</sub> to adopt mutually exclusive, metal-dependent conformational states, which led to the discovery of structurally coupled coordination sites that disfavour Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions by enforcing an unfavourable coordination geometry. Aside from highlighting flexibility as a valuable element in protein design, our results illustrate design principles for constructing selective metal sequestration agents.",
