    "abstract": "Human cancers frequently display defects in Ag processing and presentation allowing for immune evasion, and they therefore constitute a significant challenge for T cell-based immunotherapy. We have previously demonstrated that the antigenicity of tumor-associated Ags can be significantly enhanced through unconventional residue modifications as a novel tool for MHC class I (MHC-I)-based immunotherapy approaches. We have also previously identified a novel category of cancer neo-epitopes, that is, T cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPP), that are selectively presented by MHC-I on cells lacking the peptide transporter TAP. In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of the nonanchoring position 3 into a proline residue of the first identified TEIPP peptide, the murine Trh4, results in significantly enhanced recognition by antitumor CTLs toward the wild-type epitope. Although higher immunogenicity has in most cases been associated with increased MHC/peptide complex stability, our results demonstrate that the overall stability of H-2Db in complex with the highly immunogenic altered peptide ligand Trh4-p3P is significantly reduced compared with wild-type H-2Db/Trh4. Comparison of the crystal structures of the H-2Db/Trh4-p3P and H-2Db/Trh4 complexes revealed that the conformation of the nonconventional methionine anchor residue p5M is altered, deleting its capacity to form adequate sulfur-\u03c0 interactions with H-2Db residues, thus reducing the overall longevity of the complex. Collectively, our results indicate that vaccination with Thr4-p3P significantly enhances T cell recognition of targets presenting the wild-type TEIPP epitope and that higher immunogenicity is not necessarily directly related to MHC/peptide complex stability, opening for the possibility to design novel peptide vaccines with reduced MHC/peptide complex stability.",
