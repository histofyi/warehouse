    "abstract": "Immune response (Ir) genes, originally proposed by Baruj Benacerraf to explain differential antigen-specific responses in animal models, have become synonymous with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We discovered a non-MHC-linked Ir gene in a T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) locus that was required for CD8<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cell responses to the Plasmodium berghei GAP50<sub>40-48</sub> epitope in mice expressing the MHC class I allele H-2D<sup>b</sup>. GAP50<sub>40-48</sub>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cell responses emerged from a very large pool of naive V\u03b28.1<sup>+</sup> precursors, which dictated susceptibility to\u00a0cerebral malaria and conferred protection against recombinant Listeria monocytogenes infection. Structural analysis of a prototypical V\u03b28.1<sup>+</sup> TCR-H-2D<sup>b</sup>-GAP50<sub>40-48</sub> ternary complex revealed that germline-encoded complementarity-determining region 1\u03b2 residues present exclusively in the V\u03b28.1 segment mediated essential interactions with the GAP50<sub>40-48</sub> peptide. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that V\u03b28.1 functioned as an Ir gene that was indispensable for immune reactivity against the malaria GAP50<sub>40-48</sub> epitope.",
