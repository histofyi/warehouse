    "abstract": "The anti-viral T\u00a0cell response is drawn from the naive T\u00a0cell repertoire. During influenza infection, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cell response to an H-2D<sup>b</sup>-restricted nucleoprotein epitope (NP<sub>366</sub>) is characterized by preferential expansion of T\u00a0cells bearing TRBV13<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cell receptors (TCRs) and avoidance of TRBV17<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cells, despite the latter dominating the naive precursor repertoire. We found two TRBV17<sup>+</sup> TCRs that bound H-2D<sup>b</sup>-NP<sub>366</sub> with a 180\u00b0 reversed polarity compared to the canonical TCR-pMHC-I docking. The TRBV17 \u03b2-chain dominated the interaction and, whereas the complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) loops exclusively mediated contacts with the MHC-I, peptide specificity was attributable to germline-encoded recognition. Nevertheless, the TRBV17<sup>+</sup> TCR exhibited moderate affinity toward H-2D<sup>b</sup>-NP<sub>366</sub> and was capable of signal transduction. Thus, the naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T\u00a0cell pool can comprise TCRs adopting reversed pMHC-I docking modes that limit their involvement in the immune response.",
